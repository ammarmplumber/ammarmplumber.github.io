  <p>Hi, I'm Ammar. First and foremost, I'm a follower of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church.
  <br> <br>
  I work as the Chief of Staff at the <a href="adcompsystems.com">AdComp Systems Group</a>, a city government tech company in Dallas, my hometown. The company was founded by my father, and I hope to help him continue to build it.
  <br> <br>
  My educational background is in economics, philosophy, and neuroscience. I attended <a href="smtexas.org">St. Mark's School of Texas</a> for high school and completed both my undergraduate and graduate degrees at the <a href="upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>.
  <br> <br>
  I'm currently also involved in two passion projects. 
  <ul>
    <li>The first is a non-profit community development project in Dallas. This neighborhood aspires to support foster/adoptive families and the elderly, who will serve as foster grandparents for the community. To learn more about these communities, visit <a href="https://ghdc.generationsofhope.org/">Generations of Hope's website</a>.</li>
    <li>The second is <a href="https://www.resonantnotes.com">Resonant Notes</a>, a journal that I'm working on alongside some other folks. If you're interested in contributing, please get in touch with me at ammarp ~at~ sas.upenn.edu.</li>
  </ul>
