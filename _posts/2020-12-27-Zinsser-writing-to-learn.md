I recently found an old book that was assigned by my 11th grade English teacher: _On Writing Well_ by William Zinsser. Mr. Brown used to use Zinsser’s name as a verb: we ought to _Zinsser-ize_—or declutter—our writing. Why use a complex word when a simple one will suffice? And why use five words when you only need two?

My writing improved a lot in Mr. Brown’s class. Since high school, my intellectual pursuits have grown more esoteric. I use terms like “multicollinearity” and “ontological priority.” In all fairness, jargon exists to simplify communication between specialists, but, when using it, I lose track of my mystical self in a forest of semantics.

One of the most charming things about the Bible is that it was mostly written in Hebrew, a language that is simpler by nature. Its use of allegory, metaphor, and the like are quite effective for this purpose; they serve to explicate distant concepts through the lens of more familiar ones. This is what we do when we teach.

Another book by Zinsser, which I have skimmed a bit, is titled _Writing to Learn_. In the preface, he says, “Clear writing is the logical arrangement of thought; a scientist who thinks clearly can write as well as the best writer.” My experience agrees. Books by statisticians consider numerical data as effectively as books by classicists consider ancient literature. _Writing to Learn_ demonstrates this fact by providing a tasting menu of writing from various disciplines. In writing it, I’m sure Zinsser learned plenty.

I often tell people that I learned more during my year at Oxford than I did during three years at Penn. This was because Oxford’s writing demands constantly pushed me to learn on the job. When I tell people about the tutorial format and the extensive weekly reading lists, their first question is whether students did the reading. Many believe that lectures are the best way to educate because through them, students can be given information without the burden of finding it themselves. The reason I learned so much at Oxford was because, there, I had to write an essay on each topic we covered. To convey knowledge, I had to first acquire it. That’s one of the main reasons I decided to start this blog. In conveying ideas to others, like Zinsser, I hope to learn a thing or two as well.
