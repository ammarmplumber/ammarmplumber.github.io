Hi friends,

A handful of people know about my recent conversion to Christianity. For those who don't know and/or are curious about my journey, I'd like to share the ideas and experiences that sparked this change in me.

Before I was Christian, I was Muslim until my early teens and then agnostic until 22.

Hannah Lee - friend who I was attracted to. I think it was her faith that I was drawn to. I told her that God pursued me through her, among others.

That summer, I read the Book of Job. Answered the problem of evil, which was the biggest obstacle to my faith. Helped me understand the sovereignty and incomprehensibility of God.
