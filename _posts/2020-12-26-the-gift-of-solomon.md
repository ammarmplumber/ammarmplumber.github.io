What follows summarizes the story of David and Bathsheba from the Second Book of Samuel.

King David saw a beautiful woman bathing from his roof and sent a messenger to fetch her so that he could lay with her. She was Bathsheba, wife of Uriah the Hittite. Bathsheba conceived a child, and David was notified.

David tried to cover his sin by twice trying to send Uriah to his home, presumably with the hope that Uriah would sleep with Bathsheba and believe the child to be his own. On both occasions, Uriah defied David’s instructions and instead camped in the field in solidarity with his soldiers. David then instructed Joab, the commander of King David’s forces, to send Uriah to the front line of battle so that he may die. And Uriah died. After mourning for some time, Bathsheba became David’s wife and bore him a child. God was displeased with David’s sin.

The Lord sent Nathan to David to deliver his message. “Thus says the Lord, ‘Behold, I will I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun’” (12:11). “The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die” (12:13-14).

David and Bathsheba’s first child fell sick, and after seven days, he died. Bathsheba eventually birthed another child, who they called Solomon. “And the Lord loved him and sent a message by Nathan the prophet” (12:24). 

The other prophecies Nathan delivered came true. David’s son Amnon sexually violated his sister Tamar, and David’s other son Absalom murdered Amnon to avenge Tamar (13:1-33). Later, Absalom abuses his father’s concubines on the same roof from where David first lusted after Bathsheba—in the sight of all of Israel (16:21-22).

From this bleak picture, I’d like to highlight the birth of Solomon, loved by the Lord. Solomon would succeed his father as King of Israel. Repeating his father’s sins, Solomon lusted for many foreign princesses, who would turn away his heart after their gods.

Although a steep price was paid for David’s sin,—namely, the death of Bathsheba’s first child, the rape of David’s daughter by his son, fratricide, and Absalom’s public abuse of his father’s concubines—still Solomon was given with love.

My mother was the daughter of an abusive marriage between an alcoholic womanizer and a sixteen-year-old girl. My grandfather deserted my mother and grandmother when my mother was a year old. He subsequently fathered many offspring with many women, all victims of his unspeakable abuse. 

While it comes naturally to observe the costs of sin, we often neglect to rejoice in the gifts that accompany them. These gifts are not given because of sin but in spite of it.

I can assure you, like the House of David, so too did Karim Charania’s lineage pay a steep price for his sins—myself included. And yet there are blessings.
