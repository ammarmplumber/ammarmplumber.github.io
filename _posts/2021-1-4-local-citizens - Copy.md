Like many others, I grew up in an abusive household. Many of the memories were buried until recently, though I knew my father to be abusive at the time. By my estimation, there was no better alternative to my abuse. 

My relatives had somewhat simplistic views of family and weren't likely to place my well-being above their fairytales. Moreover, it was perhaps more comfortable to just support _everyone_. The family members I have in mind have said things like, "If we had known, we would have done something." I sincerely doubt that. Even after I've shared my stories, there are perpetual nudges for me to reconcile with the hope that everything will turn out okay. I have no reason to think the past would have been different. On the contrary, even the issues that were known then were addressed at arms length and with hollow advice.

The second reason I kept my abuse secret was that I felt my experiences would be trivialized. After all, I wasn't beaten or sexually abused.


Who is thy father and thy mother?



What does it mean to honor someone?

What does forgiveness entail, at minimum?
