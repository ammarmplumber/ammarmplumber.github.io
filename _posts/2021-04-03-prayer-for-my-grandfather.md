Hasanali Janmohmed was a strong, faithful man who weathered many challenges in his life. He struggled through addiction, poverty, heart failure, and familial turmoil.

Though I didn't know him until the last two decades of his life, I could see plainly that his struggles conditioned him to seek You. After his heart transplant, he grew to see his life as a gift---as a testament to your wondrousness. He became prayerful and temperate, among other things. The man I knew after the heart transplant seemed worlds apart from the one I knew before.

My grandfather was kind to me and to my dear sister, often trying to share his faith with us. I'm grateful for the time we were able to spend together---drives, meals, walks, and countless other experiences. I found beauty in his laughter, his stubbornness, and his strength.

Dear Lord of the living and the dead,

I pray that you may forgive his and our own misdeeds.

I pray that you will use his life and death to bring others closer to You. 

And I pray that you celebrate the return of your child from this fallen world.

Aameen.
