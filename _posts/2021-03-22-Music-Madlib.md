Wanted to share my three favorite songs from _Road of the Lonely Ones_, the new Madlib album. If you like what you hear, a few other Madlib albums to check out are _Bandana_ and _Pinata_---both collabs with Freddie Gibbs---and _Madvillainy_ with MF DOOM. While I really love Freddie Gibbs' rapping style, I find a lot of his language troubling. I'm glad to share the new Madlib album for this reason; it has Madlib's signature production but no rap verses.
