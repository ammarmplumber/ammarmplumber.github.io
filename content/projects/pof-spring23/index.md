In this course, we consider the role finance plays in supporting (or undermining) the common good. We also take a look at the 2008 financial crisis and assess the extent to which epistemic vices (incompetence, financial illiteracy) were responsible, as opposed to greed or appetite for risk. Other topics include medieval debates on usury, perspectives on debt accumulation, and financial exclusion.

## Course Reviews

>"PoF was a space for those who were intellectually curious about the morality of finance and economics. Ammar was uniquely suited to structuring conversations that did not have a distinct black or white nature or a set trajectory."  —[Sourish Jasti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourishjasti/), Wharton alum, Investor at Insight Partners
