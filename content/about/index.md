## Who am I?

I'm a young professional in Dallas. I'm Indian American, was raised Muslim, and became Catholic in 2022. I'm a pretty philosophical guy (some might say "in the clouds"), and I hope to develop as a speaker so that I can share my ideas and engage more effectively with others in pursuit of the truth.

## My Experience

I work in management for AdComp Systems, a government technology company founded by my father and uncle in 1989. We work with over 300 cities around the world. My official title is Chief of Staff, although I do work in several aspects of the business.

Previously, I earned a master's degree in behavioral economics and neuroscience and a bachelor's degree in economics and philosophy, both from the University of Pennsylvania. 

Along the way, I've taught a Penn student seminar on "Philosophy of Finance" for the Collegium Institute. I also conducted research for the Center of Social Norms and Behavioral Dynamics and studied philosophy in England for a year.

I am fairly proficient in software design and data science.
