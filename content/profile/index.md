## A Bit More Personal...

I really like to read and think about deep philosophical questions, and I hope to share what I learn through public speaking. While I value contemplation, I also enjoy the simple things in life — cute kids, beautiful nature, and good storytelling. In my downtime, I like to dance 💃, play basketball 🏀, and be outdoors 🌳.

## Faith and Spirituality 🙏📿

In 2022, a personal calling from God and a growing appreciation for Christian thought (which took place over several years) led me to embrace Catholicism ✝️, after being raised Muslim and losing my belief. My day isn't complete without attending mass in the morning, praying the rosary, and fostering bonds with a close-knit group of friends who share my faith.

## Travels 🌏

I wouldn't say I have wanderlust, but I enjoy traveling. My journey so far has taken me to various U.S cities, and abroad to study for a year in England. Along the way, I've visited Paris, Greece, Canada, Cuba, and India. I hope to one day walk the Camino de Santiago and feel the historic pulse of Rome.

## What I'm Looking For 💞

I hope to meet someone with a heart of gold 💛, someone rooted in truth and committed to a life of compassion and service to the Lord. I am excited about the growth and adventures we can share, grounded in faith and understanding, as we walk this path of life together.
